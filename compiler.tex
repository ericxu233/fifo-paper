\section{Compiler Support}
\label{sec:compiler}
To leverage FIFO initialization, we built a compiler toolchain using both MLIR \cite{} and LLVM \cite{} that can identify loop-carried dependences in high-level code and apply optimizations described in Section \ref{sec:optimization}. It prduces a DFG that can be mapped onto our CGRA architecture with FIFO initialization support. The overall compilation flow is shown in Figure \ref{fig:compiler_flow}.
